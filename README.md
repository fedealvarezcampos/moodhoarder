## Installing locally

Just install all deps:

```bash
# with yarn
yarn

# or npm
npm install
```

_You'll need a Supabase account and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in environment accordingly._

_`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` handles Google login and should also be set if you want to use that auth option. Supabase docs can help you with that._

## Developing

Once installed you can run in dev:

```bash
# with yarn
yarn dev

# or npm
npm run dev
```
